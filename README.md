Simple PHP Pagination

Simple PHP Pagination is a easy to use, lightweight script and it's using PHP PDO and  MySql. All you have to do is select a database you wish to pagintion items from e.g shopping cart of products, set the number of item you wish to limit per page an your all set.

Have fun with this code, Peter.
